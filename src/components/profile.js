                <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
                  Hello, I'm Thiago Carvalho, a Full Stack Developer
                  specializing in mobile and web solutions. I hold a background
                  in International Relations, an MBE in Computer Engineering,
                  and a specialization in Mobile Development. I‚Äôve worked
                  extensively with technologies such as Android (Kotlin & Java),
                  Flutter, React, React Native, Node.js, and Python.
                </Typography>
                <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
                  Throughout my career, I have successfully delivered
                  high-performance applications for industries including retail,
                  manufacturing, rentals, and more. My expertise spans
                  integrating technologies like SQL, Firebase, ERP systems, and
                  HMI SCADA solutions. Whether it‚Äôs building from the ground up
                  or deploying full-fledged systems, I focus on delivering
                  optimal solutions that meet client expectations.
                </Typography>
                <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
                  In addition to development, I can help you monetize your
                  application by implementing in-app purchases and ads with
                  strategies that maintain a great user experience. We can
                  deploy your app to platforms like the Google Play Store,
                  Amazon Appstore, Mi Store, and Apple App Store, ensuring a
                  seamless and fast launch.
